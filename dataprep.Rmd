This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
# Plotting dinosaur data
# uploading dataset and packages
  link="https://github.com/Data-Dumps/deliverable1/raw/main/dinodata.xlsx"
  library(rio) #note: Jose wants us to omit the install.packages line
  
  dinodata=import(link)
    
    Dinocountry=table(dinodata$lived_in)
    prop.table(Dinocountry)
    propT=prop.table(Dinocountry)*100
    pie(Dinocountry)
    (tableFreq=as.data.frame(Dinocountry))
    names(tableFreq)=c("Country","Count")
    tableFreq$Percent=as.vector(Dinocountry)
    tableFreq
write.csv(tableFreq,"tableFreq.csv",row.names = F)

```
```{r}
# Deliverable 3 data:

dinodata=import(link)
#str(dinodata)
DinoTable=table(dinodata$ISO3)
write.csv(DinoTable,"DinoTable.csv",row.names = F)

DinoDF=as.data.frame(DinoDF)
names(DinoDF)=c('ISO3','count')
write.csv(DinoDF,"DinoDF.csv",row.names=F)
saveRDS(DinoDF,'DinoDF.rds')



```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
